    directory

  * Compile the ui file using pyuic4

  * Compile the resources file using pyrcc4

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file:
         findduplocations.py

  * Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png

  * Modify your user interface by opening findduplocations.ui
    in Qt Designer (don't forget to compile it with pyuic4 after changing it)
